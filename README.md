# Combusting Planet - memetic website

Combusting Planet is a memetic website consisting of short-form videos on a subdomain of the user's choice. Think a [YouTube Poop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Poop) video meeting a [YTMND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YTMND) website.

All of Combusting Planet's code is based on the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework, therefore is open source under the MIT License. Go crazy!
